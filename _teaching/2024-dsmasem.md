Low-cost sensors and high communication bandwidths open up new possibilities for applications that benefit from a high amount of data. Such applications produce data continuously, potentially unbounded, and at high rates, which is subsumed under the term data stream. Examples for applications fields are smart manufacturing, high-speed trading, fraud detection, robotics, or social networks. Data stream management systems are special systems which address the specific requirements handling data streams. In this seminar we will research recent topics in data stream management and analysis, such as data compression, online learning, or operator distribution. The seminar is offered as a block seminar.

In this course students will learn how to

- search for and read relevant literature for a certain topic,
- structure their research,
- write a scientific paper about their topic,
- present and defend their topic,
- read other researchersâ€™ works and write a review about it,
- moderate a paper session
