Organizations in many domains, such as manufacturing or healthcare, have a huge demand to exchange data to enable new services, drive research and innovation, or improve patient care.
Hence, organizations require alliance-driven infrastructures capable of supporting controlled data exchange across diverse stakeholders and transparent data management. Data Ecosystems are distributed, open, and adaptive information systems with the characteristics of being self-organizing, scalable, and sustainable trying to fulfil these requirements.
But there are many open issues, which make the exchange on a technological, processual, and organizational level a challenge. In this seminar, students will identify and discuss the main challenges in data ecosystems, such as data quality, data transparency, and data integration.
