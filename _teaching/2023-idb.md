The lecture gives an introduction to the implementation of database systems. Besides the rough architecture of a DB system, detailed methods for solving individual DB tasks, such as query processing and transaction management, are presented. The concepts of implementation are demonstrated using classical relational DB systems as well as distributed and NoSQL systems. Concepts, frameworks and components of Big Data architectures, e.g. MapReduce, Apache Spark and are introduced and practically tested.
