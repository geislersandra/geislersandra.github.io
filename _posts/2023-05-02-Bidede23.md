We are very delighted, that our paper "GALOIS: A Hybrid and Platform-Agnostic Stream Processing Architecture" has been accepted for publication in the  Big Data in Emergent Distributed Environments (BiDEDE 2023) workshop at the SIGMOD conference 2023! We are very excited to present our work in Seattle, USA. We provide a preprint of the paper at the <a href="">arxiv repository</a>.
