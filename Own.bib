  abstract       = {A core task in technology management in biomedical engineering and beyond is the classification of patents into domain-specific categories, increasingly automated by machine learning, with the fuzzy language of patents causing particular problems. Striving for higher classification performance, increasingly complex models have been developed, based not only on text but also on a wealth of distinct (meta) data and methods. However, this makes it difficult to access and integrate data and to fuse distinct predictions. Although the already established Cooperate Patent Classification (CPC) offers a plethora of information, it is rarely used in automated patent categorization. Thus, we combine taxonomic and textual information to an ensemble classification system comparing stacking and fixed combination rules as fusion methods. Various classifiers are trained on title/abstract and on both the CPC and IPC (International Patent Classification) assignments of 1230 patents covering six categories of future biomedical innovation. The taxonomies are modeled as tree graphs, parsed and transformed by Dissimilarity Space Embedding (DSE) to real-valued vectors. The classifier ensemble tops the basic performance by nearly 10 points to F1 = 78.7% when stacked with a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Taxonomic base classifiers perform nearly as well as the text-based learners. Moreover, an ensemble only of CPC and IPC learners reaches F1 = 71.2% as fully language independent and straightforward approach of established algorithms and readily available integrated data enabling new possibilities for technology management.},

It aims at providing a basis for smart services and cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data owners' sovereignty over their content. The IDS Information Model is an RDFS/OWL ontology defining the fundamental concepts for describing actors in a data space, their interactions, the resources exchanged by them, and data usage restrictions. After introducing the conceptual model and design of the ontology, we explain its implementation on top of standard ontologies as well as the process for its continuous evolution and quality assurance involving a community driven by industry and research organisations. We demonstrate tools that support generation, validation, and usage of instances of the ontology with the focus on data control and protection in a federated ecosystem.},

  abstract   = {A data ecosystem (DE) offers a keystone-player or alliance-driven infrastructure that enables the interaction of different stakeholders and the resolution of interoperability issues among shared data. However, despite years of research in data governance and management, trustability is still affected by the absence of transparent and traceable data-driven pipelines. In this work, we focus on requirements and challenges that DEs face when ensuring data transparency. Requirements are derived from the data and organizational management, as well as from broader legal and ethical considerations. We propose a novel knowledge-driven DE architecture, providing the pillars for satisfying the analyzed requirements. We illustrate the potential of our proposal in a real-world scenario. Last, we discuss and rate the potential of the proposed architecture in the fulfillmentof these requirements.},

Emphasis on process support may also be used to improve data quality, which is an important prerequisite for evidence-based medicine and the training and usage of future AI tools.},

  abstract  = {The Internet of Production (IoP) leverages concepts such as digital shadows, data lakes, and a World Wide Lab (WWL) to advance today's production. Consequently, it requires a technical infrastructure that can support the agile deployment of these concepts and corresponding high-level applications, which, e.g., demand the processing of massive data in motion and at rest. As such, key research aspects are the support for low-latency control loops, concepts on scalable data stream processing, deployable information security, and semantically rich and efficient long-term storage. In particular, such an infrastructure cannot continue to be limited to machines and sensors, but additionally needs to encompass networked environments: production cells, edge computing, and location-independent cloud infrastructures. Finally, in light of the envisioned WWL, i.e., the interconnection of production sites, the technical infrastructure must be advanced to support secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. To evolve today's production sites and lay the infrastructural foundation for the IoP, we identify five broad streams of research: (1) adapting data and stream processing to heterogeneous data from distributed sources, (2) ensuring data interoperability between systems and production sites, (3) exchanging and sharing data with different stakeholders, (4) network security approaches addressing the risks of increasing interconnectivity, and (5) security architectures to enable secure and privacy-preserving industrial collaboration. With our research, we evolve the underlying infrastructure from isolated, sparsely networked production sites toward an architecture that supports high-level applications and sophisticated digital shadows while facilitating the transition toward a WWL.},

This paper explores the role of multi-perspective modeling and view modeling in designing distributed, heterogeneous systems while addressing diverse user requirements and ensuring semantic consistency. These methods enable the representation of multiple viewpoints, traceability, and dynamic integration across different levels of abstraction. Key advancements in schema mapping, view maintenance, and semantic metadata management are examined, illustrating how they support query optimization, data quality, and interoperability. We discuss how data management architectures, such as data ecosystems, data warehouses, and data lakes, leverage these innovations to enable flexible and sustainable data sharing. By integrating user-centric and goal-oriented modeling frameworks, the alignment of technical design with organizational and social requirements is emphasized. Future challenges include the need for enhanced reasoning capabilities and collaborative tools to manage the growing complexity of interconnected systems while maintaining adaptability and trust.},

  abstract = {In the past years, there has been an increased interest in sharing and reusing research data. While the importance of sharing data is urgent for enabling collaboration, many research projects are currently struggling with setting up a strategy and the right infrastructure for enabling such data-driven collaboration among the project\’s researchers. Through an analysis of the Cluster of Excellence project Internet of Production as a use case, we have found that to enable researchers to share and find research data, a suitable platform is needed, as well as processes that smoothly blend into existing research data management practices. We argue that leveraging data management plans from a medium of documentation to a dynamic knowledge source enhances overview and discoverability of data, while integrating easily into day-to-day workflows of researchers. We present a tool, the Dataset Finder, which is built on the basis of data management plans, and allows users to intuitively query available datasets. The current functionalities of the tools are discussed, results of a preliminary evaluation, as well as potential future features.},
